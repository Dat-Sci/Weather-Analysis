Weather Trends: Comparing Daily Max & Min Temperatures (2005-2014 vs 2015)
A time series analysis of temperature variations across two consecutive years.
 * Maximum and minimum daily temperatures against months for each day in the year between the years 2005 and 2014, with the exceeding values of the year 2015.


**overview** /n
The focus is on understanding whether temperature extremes changed significantly and what this might indicate about local climate variation.

Features and cleaning are described in the file in a coherent way.


**insight**
Expectations were set to about a few points in summer for higher temperatures, and vice versa for winter periods. However, the results were surprising as "highs and lows" were more than expected and were happening all thoughout the year. For example, black points in the autumn period, and untill late winter, not many "low" points were discovered but rather "high" points with greater ratio than the low points. As an individual who is not experienced in eath's atmosphere I could not find a link to real-life implications like global warming, as this visual is not enough data to conclude anything related to that. However, conclusion can be drawn as there are unexpected change in weather in terms of temperature rises and falls.

**Visual efficiency**
* As the visual has a considerably higher ink-data ration, it uses a banalaced amount of embelishments while still focusing on functionality as the shaded area and labels makes it easier to understand and study.

* Chart junks are thrown out of this visual, making it effecient for analysing the data and numerics it has.

* In addition, the visual does not expose any sign of misleading mechanisms for data or misleading information.
